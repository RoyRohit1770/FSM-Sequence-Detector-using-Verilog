Moore State Machine for Sequence Detection

This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) using the Moore model to detect the binary sequence 1011. It is designed in Verilog HDL, targeting applications in digital design and sequential logic analysis.. The state machine transitions through four states based on the input signal and asserts an output when the sequence is detected. The implementation includes a testbench to verify the functionality of the state machine. The state machine is overlapping, meaning it does  detect overlapping occurrences of the sequence. This project is useful for understanding state machine design and sequence detection in digital systems.
